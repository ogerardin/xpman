# X-Plane Manager
X-Plane Manager (or XPman) is intended to be a configuration manager for Laminar Research's wonderful flight simulator X-Plane.

Such tools exist but they are not cross-platform, have limited functionality, are difficult to use or are payware.


## Goals and assumptions
- Manage X-Plane aircrafts, scenery, plugins and extensions
- Work on all platforms supported by X-Plane (Windows, Mac, Linux)  
- Offer idiomatic installation (e.g. setup.exe on Windows) and close-to-native look and feel


## Architecture
- Standalone JavaFX application

## Status
Currently in development stages. Check [feature status](https://github.com/ogerardin/xpman/blob/master/features.md).
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! At this point I can't guarantee that it won't erase the whole X-Plane directory or set fire to your house.

# Installing X-Plane Manager
If you already have a [Java 8 runtime](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html), 
grab the jar from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ogerardin/xpman/releases) and run it by double-clicking.

if you don't or if it doesn't work for some reason, grab the full bundle most appropriate for your platform and install
it.
